Learning to use GitHub

ABOUT ME:
I am a mechanistic chemist that believes that scientists should know how to code. Data handling and task automation are my main interests.
I am reasonably comfortable with Python and have learned a tiny bit of Haskell.
I am interested in learning Java (for speed and universality) and Lua (for WoW addons).
